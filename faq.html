        <p>We recommend you to read our FAQ page before ordering your personal masterpiece so you could get a better understanding of how do we work first. Here you will find answers to most of your questions, but if we have forgotten to mention something, contact us <a href="contact-us.html">here</a></p>
        <h2><strong>Top 5 Most Frequently Asked Questions</strong></h2>
        <h3>1. What to make an order?</h3>
        <p> You will find a detailed explanation on this on <a href="store/c1/featured-products.html">our Order Page</a>.</p>
        <h3>2. How much time does it take for the portrait to get finished?</h3>
        <p>It usually takes from 2 to 7 days, but the answer to this question is variable and depends on a few things - how busy we are at the moment of the order, will the portrait be in Black and White or in Colour, if it's a single or a family portrat, etc.</p>
        <h3>3. What should my photo be like?</h3>
        <p>Remember that we can only draw what we see on the photo provided by you. It is therefore important to provide a good quality photo, normally with a size of least 1 MB and a high resolution. If you are unsure, feel free to send us your photo <a href="contact-us.html">here</a> and we will get in touch.</p>
        <h3>4. Can you combine people/pets from different photos into a single painting?</h3>
        <p>Yes, we can! It is actually very common to do so. You can upload several photographs and have different subjects from each photo combined together. Simply give us detailed instructions when placing your order. We could draw a single portrait of your children, using a separate reference photo for each one of them, or make you a portrait of you, wearing the clothes you were with on your favourite photo but using your wedding photographs as a reference for your hairstyle. Don’t be afraid to get creative!</p>
        <h3>5. Can I preview my painting online before it gets sent?</h3>
        <p> Yes indeed! Once the painting from your photo is ready, we will contact you to review it online. Most of our customers are happy with their first preview. However, if you feel that any modifications should be made, we receive your feedback, make the requested modifications and send it back to you for confirmation. Only then is the custom painting is sent to you.</p>

            </div>

            <div class="six columns">
                <h3>Which photos can I turn into painted portraits?</h3>
                <p>If we can clearly see the details of your photo we can make a quality painted portrait out of any photo you send to us. Still, from our experience, we recommend that you pay close attention to the following:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Send photos that flatter the photographed person. It is important that you select good photos. Images that say something to you. Not always the “deep smile” in the picture is good for a portrait. And a direct look at the camera is not always required. An amazing portrait needs a great photo.</li>
                    <li>The expression, the eyes, the pose…Everything counts to make a portrait truly special. If you have doubts about the way you look in the photo, if you think that the smile doesn't look real, or the nose looks too big, try and pick another.</li>
                    <li>It’s strongly recommended the photo not to be full-length. It should instead be focusing on the faces and it should be showing just the upper part of people’s body. If you still, however, really want to order a portrait from a full-length, <a href="contact-us.html">contact us</a>  and we will give you our objective opinion.</li>
                </ul>
                <h3>What file format should my photo be?</h3>
                <p>The preferred file types for receiving your photos are .jpeg, .bmp, or .tiff. We suggest sending the highest resolution and quality photo available, no matter how big the file is. The better the quality of the original photo, the better the results will be. You may send us the photograph <a href="contact-us.html">here</a> if you are unsure of its suitability.</p>
                <h3>Where to send my photos?</h3>
                <p>Please email them to masterpiecedirect@gmail.com. You can easily do that <a href="contact-us.html">here</a>.</p>
                <h3>What if my photo is damaged or not of the highest quality?</h3>
                <p>Simply email us the picture using <a href="contact-us.html">our contact form</a> and we can then give you advise on the photo and let you know if it is suitable.</p>
                <h3>I have a printed photo, how should I send it to you?</h3>
                <p>Although we acknowledge that some of our clients can have some fairly distant memories they would like captured or simply love their traditional film cameras, we ourselves prefer to work with digital media. Therefore, we would kindly ask you to scan your printed photo and send it to us <a href="contact-us.html">here</a>.
                <h3>What is the portrait size?</h3>
                <p>The size of the portraits may vary up to a maximum size of 50x65 cm (20x25 inches) depending on the reference photos. As a rule of thumb, our artists will draw paintings whereby the head/shoulders of the characters are real life sized.</a>.

            <div class="six columns">
                <h3>How many people you can draw on one portrait?</h3>
                <p>Now that's probably the only thing we can't give a definitive answer to. We very rarely draw more than five subjects in a portrait as our 20 years' experience, but this doesn’t mean that mean it’s impossible to get a portrait of a larger number of people.</p>

                <h3>Can you combine several photos into a single painting?</h3>
                <p>Yes, we can! It is actually very common to do so. You can upload several photographs and have different subjects from each photo combined together. Simply give us detailed instructions when placing your order. We could draw a single portrait of your children, using a separate reference photo for each one of them, or make you a portrait of you, wearing the clothes you were with on your favourite photo but using your wedding photographs as a reference for your hairstyle. Don’t be afraid to get creative!</p>

                <h3>Which is the best medium for my photo?</h3>
                <p>The best medium to choose is, above all, a matter of personal taste. Our most popular medium is black and white pastel, however, it is up to you to decide which one you like the most! Again, if you are unsure about your options, give us a shout at masterpiecedirect@gmail.com. To do that, you could simply use <a href="contact-us.html">our contact form</a>.</p>

                <h3>How will my masterpiece be packaged?</h3>
                <p>Your masterpiece will be packaged carefully and shipped to you via courier in a secure custom made box.</p>

                <h3>Which countries do you ship to and how much does it cost?</h3>
                <p>We offer <strong>free delivery within Europe</strong> on orders <strong>above £99.95.</strong></p>
                <p>To most other countries, we charge a flat shipping rate of between £10 and £20. This includes the shipping and handling as well as the insurance of the shipped items regardless of quantity or size.</p>

                <h3>If I order several items will shipping cost more?</h3>
                <p>When ordering several items from outside Europe in a single order you will only be charged once for shipping (the shipping charge is the same as for one item).</p>

                <h3>What methods of payment do you accept?</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li>Credit or debit card</li>

            <div class="six columns">
                <h3>Can I preview my painting before receiving it?</h3>
                <p>Yes indeed! Once the painting from your photo is ready, we will contact you to review it online. Most of our customers are happy with their first preview. However, if you feel that any modifications should be made, we receive your feedback, make the requested modifications and send it back to you for confirmation. Only then is the custom painting is sent to you.</p>

                <h3>I would like to ask for modifications. How do I do this?</h3>
                <p>Please try and be as complete and as clear as possible when initially ordering your portrait. If, however, you would require further adjustments, feel free to send us an email at masterpiecedirect@gmail.com. You can easily do that <a href="contact-us.html">here</a>.</p>

                <h3>Do you charge extra for modifications?</h3>
                <p>No, we don't charge extra. All modifications are free of charge. However, It will be considerably harder to make those changes once the final version of the portrait has been agreed by you.</p>

                <h3>I have not received the shipping notification?</h3>
                <p>Please allow 2-4 days from the day you confirmed you are happy with your painting until we ship your painting and send you the shipping notification email.</p>

                <h3>What if I need to return a painting?</h3>
                <p>We closely inspect all of our paintings before sending them and use the trusted courier services to handle them en route to your house. If a painting, however, does arrive in anything less than immaculate condition then we do encourage you to contact us without delay so that we can resolve this for you. Take a photo of any damage which has occurred and send this along with a brief description of the issue to masterpiecedirect@gmail.com. (or use <a href="contact-us.html">our contact form</a>) We will try and respond to your inquiry within 24 hours and should the painting be faulty will request that you return the damaged product to us and happily either fix the damaged portrait or craft a new one for you.</p>

                <h3>Will you use my photo and painting on your website?</h3>
                <p>Sometimes we do use the photos and finished paintings on <a href="https://web.facebook.com/masterpiecedirect">our Facebook page</a>, website, newsletter and other marketing artwork because we’re proud of our work and it also helps us show others the ways they can use our portrait service. If you would rather we didn't use your photo and / or painting however, simply notify us and we won’t use it. You can do this either by emailing us at <a href="mailto:masterpiecedirect@gmail.com">masterpiecedirect@gmail.com</a>.</p>

                <h3>Is my private information protected?</h3>
                <p>Yes it is. All the information gathered through our secure server will be used solely to process your orders. We will never sell or share your private information with any third party. Here is our privacy policy.</p>
