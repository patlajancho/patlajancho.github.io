      <p>By using http://www.masterpiecedirect.co.uk (the “Website”) you accept these terms and conditions (the “Terms”) regardless of whether or not you choose to place an order with us. If you do not accept the Terms, please do not use the Website.</p>

      <h2><b>Introduction</b></h2>
      <p>You will be able to access most areas of the Website without providing any of your details to us. However, certain areas of the Website will require information provided by you, such as our order process, which may require you to upload a photo or provide other details prior to placing an order.</p>

      <p>We may revise the Terms at any time by updating this posting. You should check the Website from time to time to review the current Terms, because they are binding on you. Certain provisions of the Terms may be superseded by expressly designated legal notices or terms located on particular pages of the Website. If you do not wish to accept any new terms and conditions after we have given notice, you should not continue to use the Website.</p>


      <h2><b>Placing an order</b></h2>
      <p>You are deemed to place an order with us by ordering via our online checkout process. We will send you an order confirmation by email, detailing the specifications of the product(s) you have ordered.</p>
      <p>For products that are not personalised, our acceptance of an order takes place when we despatch the products. When we despatch the products the purchase contract will be made even if your payment has been processed immediately, unless we have notified you that we do not accept your order or you have cancelled your order.</p>
      <p>For products that are personalised (e.g. original handmade portraits), our acceptance of an order takes place when one of our artists commences to work on your order. When an artist commences to work on your order the purchase contract will be made even if your payment has been processed immediately, unless we have notified you that we do not accept your order or you have cancelled your order.</p>
      <p>We may refuse to accept an order:</p>
      <ul>
          <li>Where products are not available;</li>
          <li>Where our artists do not have additional capacity;</li>
          <li>Where we cannot obtain authorisation for your payment;</li>
          <li>If there has been a pricing or product description error;</li>
          <li>If you do not meet any eligibility criteria set out in the Terms;</li>
          <li> If the order is to be delivered outside of the territories to which we deliver; and</li>
          <li>If your order for personalised products contains content which is threatening, defamatory, obscene, indecent, seditious, offensive, pornographic, abusive, liable to incite racial hatred, discriminatory, menacing, scandalous, inflammatory, blasphemous, in breach of confidence, in breach of privacy or which may cause annoyance or inconvenience.</li>
      </ul>

      <h2><b>Pricing</b></h2>
      <p>Prices for all products listed on the Website are inclusive of VAT where applicable in the context of current UK laws and regulations. We do not show prices exclusive of VAT anywhere on the Website.</p>
      <p>Where we charge separately for packing, postage or insurance and other relevant charges, the appropriate rates are set out in our specified pricing structure shown elsewhere on the Website.</p>

      <h2><b>Delivery</b></h2>
      <p>We will deliver the Products ordered by you to the address which you give for delivery when you place your order. If any of the details you have given us in your delivery address are incorrect, we are not liable for any items which have not been received.</p>
      <p>You may specify a delivery address which is different from your billing address, if, for example, you would like us to deliver the Products directly to a friend, a relative, or to your place of work.</p>
      <p>We do not deliver outside of the territories specified in the checkout process.</p>
      <p>We will despatch your order as soon as possible unless you specify otherwise and contact us via email.</p>
      <p>Whilst we make every effort to deliver goods within the specified timescale, on occasion due to unforeseen circumstances we cannot always guarantee delivery in said time, or accept liability for deliveries made outside this timescale. We cannot accept liability for out of pocket expenses or other costs incurred due to failed or delayed deliveries.</p>
      <p>If the product(s) you have ordered do not arrive within 28 days of placing the order, MasterpieceDirect cannot accept any liability unless you have contacted us via email within this period.</p>
      <p>The majority of our products are despatched by a courier chosen by us. It is estimated that your order will be delivered to you within 7 workings days following despatch. If you have not received your items, you must check with your local sorting office even if you have not received notification from your postman that they are holding items for you.</p>
      <p>In the event that we reproduce an item for you and subsequently the original is returned as undelivered by the couriers, we reserve the right to charge an administrative fee up to 100% of the sales price of the reproduced product.</p>
      <p>In the event you have not received your order, we must allow the following timescales before we can take further action, and claim back from the relevant carrier for lost items.</p>
      <ul>
          <li>Standard delivery: 14 working days from date of despatch</li>
          <li>Express delivery: 10 working days from date of despatch</li>
      </ul>

      <h2><b>Order cancellations</b></h2>
      <p>For most items, you have the legal right to cancel your order within 7 working days of receiving the goods. However, this does not apply to certain items which we have made, personalised or customised specifically for you.</p>
      <p>Order cancellations must be made in writing, quoting your order number, within 7 working days beginning the day after the day on which the item is delivered.</p>
      <p>You may cancel a portrait commission order after reviewing a draft if you notify us within 24 hours of receiving the draft, quoting a sensible reason for the cancellation. You will be refunded 25% of the commission’s original price should you choose to not receive the final piece of art. The funds we retain will cover transaction fees, the work done by our artists, and MasterpieceDirect’s services. If you wish to cancel your order you can notify us by email to <script>document.write('<a class="link" href="mailto:masterpiecedirect@gmail.com"><b>masterpiecedirect@gmail.com</b></a>');
      </script> before we have dispatched the final piece of art.</p>
      <p>Where goods have already been dispatched to you, the goods must be returned to us in accordance with the 'Returns and exchange' section below.</p>
      <p>We reserve the right to cancel your order at any time and issue a full refund.</p>
      <p>The provisions of this clause do not affect your statutory rights.</p>
      <h2><b>Returns and exchange</b></h2>
      <p>If you are not completely satisfied with your non-personalised goods, simply return them to us at any time within 14 working days of receipt. The costs of returning goods to us shall be borne by you. Unfortunately we are unable to refund postage costs on unwanted non-personalised items.</p>
      <p>The item is your responsibility until it reaches us. For your own protection, we recommend that you send the parcel back to using a delivery service that insures you for the value of the goods as we cannot be held responsible for items damaged or lost in the post.</p>
      <p>Your rights to return the products to us will not apply in the following circumstances:</p>
      <p>Any products that we have been personalised or customised specifically for you;</p>
      <p>Where, in our opinion, you have not taken reasonable care of goods whilst in your possession and have not been returned with the original packaging;</p>
      <p>If you return an item because of an error on our part, or because it is defective, we will happily refund the full value of the item. You can contact us at <script>document.write('<a class="link" href="mailto:masterpiecedirect@gmail.com"><b>masterpiecedirect@gmail.com</b></a>');
      </script> for a freepost returns address.</p>
      <p>The item(s) must be returned in the condition in which you received it within 30 days of delivery. By the very individual nature of personalised products, they cannot be re-sold, and therefore we cannot accept returns if you have a change of mind.</p>
      <p>Please note:</p>
      <p>You have a duty to return the item to us and the cost of doing so is your responsibility, except if the item is faulty or does not comply with the contract.</p>
      <p>This returns policy does not affect your statutory rights.</p>
      <h2><b>Our Refund Policy</b></h2>
      <p>If your commission is not completed and delivered within the listed turnaround time, you have the option to cancel your order and receive a full refund at any point before the final work is delivered. Keep in mind that turnaround time does not include days spent awaiting responses from you (for example, if you wait three days before giving feedback on an artist’s draft, those three days will not be counted as part of the turnaround time). If a final work is delivered late, but you never cancelled the order, you cannot ask for a refund unless the work does not meet MasterpieceDirect’s Quality Standards.</p>
      <p>We will give you 20% refund for every full week beyond our standard 25 day turnaround time.</p>
      <p>We do not provide refunds if you are unhappy with the final piece you receive. Artists spend significant amounts of time to create original work, and as long as they deliver what they promise (i.e., work that meets our Quality Standards), they deserve to be paid.</p>
      <p>You will, however, receive a full refund if:</p>
      <ul>
          <li>Work you ordered is never delivered.</li>
          <li>Work you ordered does not present the artistic style of the commission sample you selected and you notify us of the problem via our quality assurance page or the message through which we deliver your final work of art within 48 hours of your work’s delivery.</li>
          <li>Work you ordered does not feature the same level of detail or quality shown in the commission sample you selected and you notify us of the problem via email.</li>
      </ul>

      <h2><b>Discounts</b></h2>
      <p>If a discount was applied to your original order, the amount refunded will be adjusted to allow for the revised order value and appropriate discount level. Please note you can only use one discount code per order.</p>

      <h2><b>I received the wrong item</b></h2>
      <p>If the item you received is not what you originally ordered, please contact us quoting your order number, your name and address, details of the product and the reason for return, and whether you require a refund or a replacement. We will then advise on how to proceed with the return.</p>

      <p>Photo Upload</p>
      <p>In using the Photo Upload facility on the Website, you agree not to upload or print any images that will cause distress or offence to any person. It is your responsibility to ensure that express permission for any images you use has been granted by the owner of any image. MasterpieceDirect reserves the right to refuse to process any order that may cause offence or distress to others – in such a case we will refund any payment made. MasterpieceDirect will not be responsible for any copyright infringement by the customer.</p>

     <h2><b>Licence</b></h2>

      <p>The Website and all its related content and images, including but not limited to: the MasterpieceDirect logo, all designs, text, graphics, pictures, the look and feel of the site, information, data, software, video files and other files (collectively referred to as the 'site materials') are the proprietary property of MasterpieceDirect and are protected by trade dress, copyright, trademark laws and various other intellectual property rights and unfair competition laws.</p>
      <p>You may retrieve and display the content of the Website on a computer screen, store such content in electronic form on disk (but not any server or other storage device connected to a network) or print one copy of such content for your own personal, non-commercial use, provided you keep intact all and any copyright and proprietary notices. You may not otherwise reproduce, modify, copy or distribute or use for commercial purposes any of the materials or content on the Website without written permission from us.</p>
      <p>Unless otherwise stated, the copyright and other intellectual property rights in all material on the Website (including without limitation photographs and graphical images) are owned by us or our artists. For the purposes of the Terms, any use of extracts from the Website other than in accordance with the clause above for any purpose is prohibited. If you breach any of the terms in the Terms, your permission to use the Website automatically terminates and you must immediately destroy any downloaded or printed extracts from the Website. </p>
      <p>No part of the Website may be reproduced or stored in any other website or included in any public or private electronic retrieval system or service without our prior written permission. </p>
      <p>Any rights not expressly granted in these terms are reserved.</p>

      <h2><b>Service Access</b></h2>
      <p>While we endeavour to ensure that the Website is normally available 24 hours a day, we will not be liable if for any reason the Website is unavailable at any time or for any period. </p>
      <p>Access to the Website may be suspended temporarily and without notice in the case of system failure, maintenance or repair or for reasons beyond our control.</p>
      <h2><b>Applicable Law</b></h2>
      <p>These Terms and Conditions and your use of the Website will be governed by and construed in accordance with the laws of the United Kingdom. You agree that any action at law or in equity arising out of or relating to the Terms shall be filed only in the courts located in the United Kingdom and you hereby irrevocably and unconditionally consent and submit to the exclusive jurisdiction of such courts over any suit, action or proceeding arising out of your use of this site, any purchase from this site, or the Terms.</p>
      <h2><b>Our Quality Guarantee</b></h2>
      <p>We offer personalised art of high quality on the Website. If you are given commissioned art that does not meet our Quality Standards, you may submit a dispute and receive a full refund.</p>
      <h2><b>Our Quality Standards</b></h2>
      <p>When you order a commission based on an artist’s specific sample, you can expect to receive art in return featuring:</p>
      <ul>
          <li>Work in the style of the sample you selected.</li>
          <li>Work featuring detail and quality equivalent to the samples associated with the commission style you selected.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>Whether work you ordered does or does not adequately depict your subject(s), the style, level of quality, or level of detail presented in the sample selected will be determined by a panel of at least five other artists who provide work on our site. We defer to the opinion of artists rather than MasterpieceDirect staffs, as artists within our network have a stake in our site’s reputation, but not our general profits (or those of the artist in question). Our network of artists will only review quality disputes, not all work that is delivered through MasterpieceDirect.</p>
      <p>If you do not submit a quality dispute for review within 48 hours of your work being delivered, we cannot provide a refund.</p>
